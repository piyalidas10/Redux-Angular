# Redux Pattern (component -> Actions -> Reducers -> Store -> Component)

1. Component dispatch the action. Action is nothing than an object with type & payload.
2. Action will reach to reducer. Reducer is a pure function that not dependent on external variable. It makes sure that updates of States will be predictable. Reducer will check action type & payload.Â 
3. Reducer will return data to the store / state which is new state.
4. Component directly consume data from store
